# Cloudflare Stream documentation

Cloudflare Stream provides end-to-end video infrastructure at scale. Stream handles storage, encoding and adaptive bitrate playback for you so you can focus your core idea.

To get started with Stream, simply visit the Stream Dashboard in your Cloudflare account or [sign up](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/stream). Your stream videos are not attached to an domain in your Cloudflare account and you don't need a domain on Cloudflare to use Stream.
